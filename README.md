# RTS Monitor

<h2> Our goal </h2>
<p>
  This is a simple blackjack game simulator featuring the player (you), 3 other players, as well as the dealer. The program has the ability of calculating the probability of busting the player's hand when reaching certain thresholds (e.g. a hand of 18 points), and from that the player can make a sound judgment whether he/she should take the risk of calling another card, or choose to stand and conclude the current round.

<h2> What it does </h2>
<p>
 RTS Monitor is a system that integrates hardware and software to present real-time data onto a web page, as well as notifying operators of system status via Slack messaging. Our system has the advantage of flexibility in that various types of sensor outputs can be tracked and displayed onto graphs. The RTS Monitor also enables two-way communication that allows operators to manipulate sensor control properties through our web UI. For example, an operator could enter a desired RPM value on the web UI, which in turn is received by the raspberry-pi that informs the motor controller to set the motor to the desired RPM.
