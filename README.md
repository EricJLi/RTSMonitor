Our Goal

What it does
RTS Monitor is a system that integrates hardware and software to present real-time data onto a web page, as well as notifying operators of system status via Slack messaging. Our system has the advantage of flexibility in that various types of sensor outputs can be tracked and displayed onto graphs. The RTS Monitor also enables two-way communication that allows operators to manipulate sensor control properties through our web UI. For example, an operator could enter a desired RPM value on the web UI, which in turn is received by the raspberry-pi that informs the motor controller to set the motor to the desired RPM.

How We built it
Hardware: Designed breadboard circuit that enables connections between the raspberry-pi, our experimental sensors,
